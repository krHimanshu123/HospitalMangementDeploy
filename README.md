## Features
- Feature 1 — concise description
- Feature 2 — concise description
- Feature 3 — concise description
- Roadmap / planned features (optional)

## Tech Stack
- Language(s): e.g., JavaScript (Node.js) / Python / Go / Java
- Frameworks: e.g., Express / FastAPI / React / Vue
- Database: e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- CI/CD: e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI
- Containerization: Docker
- Other: Testing frameworks, linters, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
List required software and versions. Example:
- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9 or yarn >= 1.22
- Docker (optional)
- PostgreSQL >= 12 (if applicable)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
# Node (example)
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Configuration
Explain required environment variables or config files. Provide an example .env:

```env
# .env.example
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Add steps to create the `.env` from `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then update values in .env
```

### Running Locally
Start the application in development mode:

```bash
# Node example
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Optional: how to run with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t {{project_name}} .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env {{project_name}}
```

## Usage
Describe how to use the application after starting it. Include sample commands and expected outputs, or example API requests.

Example HTTP request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password"}'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6..."
}
```

## Examples
Add short, copy-pasteable examples for common workflows or integrations (CLI usage, SDK usage, sample scripts).

## API Documentation
If applicable, point to autogenerated API docs (Swagger, Redoc) or include a link.

- Swagger UI: http://localhost:3000/docs

Or include brief list of endpoints:

- GET /api/v1/items — list items
- POST /api/v1/items — create item
- GET /api/v1/items/:id — get item

## Testing
Describe test strategy and how to run tests:

```bash
# run unit tests
npm test

# run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

Mention recommended testing types: unit, integration, end-to-end.

## Deployment
Describe deployment options and recommended best practices, e.g., Docker, Kubernetes manifests, example GitHub Actions workflow snippet.

Example GitHub Actions snippet (high level):

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
```
